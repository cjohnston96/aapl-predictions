# AAPL Predictions Using Predictive Modeling and Time-Series Analysis Techniques

Using R, I created a simple ARIMA model after determining if the data was stable and suitable for an ARIMA model. Afterwards,
I generated a simple Geometric Brownian motion to observe how closely it predicts when only running one model. This can easily be 
changed to simulate 1000s as well.
